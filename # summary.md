# Summary of Modifications for ProposalOS Knowledge Base Building

This document summarizes the modifications made to each script to enable building a comprehensive knowledge base (KB) for generating full Cost Volumes in ProposalOS. Each update incorporates guardrails for EoC interpretation (direct vs. indirect, rate structures, citations, contract-type context) and ensures all EoCs are covered, even as placeholders. The changes support exhaustive coverage of FAR/DFARS/CAS, NIST, ITAR, EAR, and other standards, with emphasis on thresholds, timelines, penalties, and compliance incentives.

## 1. updated_complile_reports.py
- **Purpose**: Enhances the RFP discovery pipeline to extract and structure all EoCs with contextual logic.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Updated `make_prompt_rfp_discovery` to explicitly target all EoCs, classify direct/indirect, cite regulations, and adapt to contract type/program specifics.
  - Modified `apply_sanity_and_truncate` to adjust classifications (e.g., Fee in FFP).
  - In `run_rfp_discovery`, added placeholders for missing EoCs to ensure exhaustive coverage.
- **Impact**: Ensures the KB includes full EoC facts, preventing incomplete outputs like only Subcontracts. Aligns with scenario awareness (e.g., FFP vs. CPFF) and regulatory citations.

## 2. updated_sandbox_validate_kb.py
- **Purpose**: Validates and normalizes KB facts with contract-type-specific sanity scoring.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Enhanced `ELEMENT_HINTS` for contract-type nuances (e.g., Fee in FFP).
  - Updated `sanity_score` to penalize mismatches (e.g., Fee as cost in FFP).
  - Added `--contract-type` CLI arg to pass context during validation.
- **Impact**: Enforces direct/indirect classifications and regulatory relevance, ensuring validated KB facts for compliant Cost Volumes.

## 3. updated_gemini_integration_final.py
- **Purpose**: Improves entity extraction for contextual EoC interpretation.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Modified `extract_entities` prompt to classify direct/indirect, cite regulations, and adjust for contract type/program specifics.
  - Added `contract_type` and `program_specifics` args to the method.
- **Impact**: Enables agents to interpret EoCs in context (e.g., burdened rates in CPFF), with exhaustive citations and flags for TINA/CAS.

## 4. updated_sandbox_cost_volume_assembler.py
- **Purpose**: Assembles a full skeletal Cost Volume with all EoCs.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Updated `main` to include all `wanted_order` EoCs, even if no facts (adds placeholders like "- _No citations extracted_").
- **Impact**: Guarantees a complete Cost Volume output, covering all EoCs with compliance notes, regardless of input data sparsity.

## 5. updated_knowledge_graph_builder.py
- **Purpose**: Builds a graph with contract-type awareness for queryable KB.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Updated `build_graph` to include `contract_type` in EoC nodes.
  - Added `--contract-type` CLI arg.
- **Impact**: Integrates contextual EoC data into the graph, enabling traversals for compliance checks (e.g., TINA thresholds) and scenario-aware queries.

These modifications ensure the KB is robust, compliant, and exhaustive, supporting full Cost Volume generation while adhering to FAR/DFARS/CAS thresholds, penalties, and applicability. Run the updated scripts in sequence: complile_reports.py → sandbox_validate_kb.py → sandbox_cost_volume_assembler.py → knowledge_graph_builder.py.
