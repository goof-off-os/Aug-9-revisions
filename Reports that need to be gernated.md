Yes. and DFAR and FAR is pretty general aside from the few actually standard and reuiqred forms and reports it cites. This is the part whre we need to anticipate their needs/wants. understand what aspects of the proposal from a financial and compliance standpoint would be interesting/useful for a Proposal Analyst/Estimator. At this stage, Im proceeding with a simple UI though it will be developed further: The UI will have a NLI, mode dropdown fields, and other input fields for thins like Fee, contract type etc. proposalOS will also scrape the RFP (or other betttery option than scraping) and verify the inputs as accurate and flag/ask questions to the user if conflicting information. the system will never override the user or change any inputs without asking permisson of the human user via questions. The user will also input the end-point customer (and if we're a sub or prime) and based on that forms will be generated based on that customer's preference. that customization may involve agents going and ...well something. havnt thought that through yet. Maybe there's a better way to do that.
